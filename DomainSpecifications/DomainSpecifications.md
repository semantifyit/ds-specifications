# Domain Specifications

Since the concept of Domain Specifications has been enhanced multiple times, documentation for the different versions is provided:

* [DS-V1](./DS-V1/DS-V1.md)
* [DS-V2](./DS-V2/DS-V2.md)
* [DS-V3](./DS-V3/DS-V3.md)
* [DS-V4](./DS-V4/DS-V4.md)
* [DS-V5](./DS-V5/DS-V5.md)
* [DS-V6](./DS-V6/DS-V6.md)
* [DS-V7](./DS-V7/DS-V7.md)


Note that the term "Verification" was introduced as our standard to define the process of checking the compliance of given data based on a given domain specification. Before that we used the term "Validation", which could still appear on some parts of this documentation.
