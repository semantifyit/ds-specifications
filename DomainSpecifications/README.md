# Domain Specifications

A Domain Specification (DS) is a formalized, machine-readable, and structured document that defines syntactic and semantic, domain-specific constraints for Schema.org annotations.
The main purpose of Domain Specifications is to define a standard to which schema.org annotations have to comply, this is checked during a process called "domain-specific verification". Domain Specifications can also be used as a dynamic guidelines for the creation, mapping and presentation of structured data.  

Since the concept of Domain Specifications has been enhanced multiple times, documentation for the different versions is provided:

* [DS-V1](DS-V1/README.md)
* [DS-V2](DS-V2/README.md)
* [DS-V3](DS-V3/README.md)
* [DS-V4](DS-V4/README.md)
* [DS-V5](DS-V5/README.md)
* [DS-V6](DS-V6/README.md)
* [DS-V7](DS-V7/README.md)

Note that the term "Verification" was introduced as our standard to define the process of checking the compliance of given data based on a given domain specification. Before that we used the term "Validation", which could still appear on some parts of this documentation.
