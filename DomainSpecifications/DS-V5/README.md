# DS-V5

This specification version contains further improvements to DS-V4, which include:

* Adaptions on `@context`
* Addition of a system to include external vocabularies
* Addition of advanced value constraints from SHACL
* Addition of errors related to new constraints
* Adaptions on how to represent the author of a DS
* An optional JSON-LD serialization of Verification Reports
* Introduction of a Vocabulary File for DS-related specifications

The motivation for these changes is the need for features like the use of external vocabularies beside schema.org, the introduction of lists as JSON-LD documents, and the need for further constraints.

Although the DS-Vocabulary file (for DS-related specifications) and the list specification were created based on DS-V5, they are explained for the most part in their respective specifications ([List-V1](../../Lists/List-V1/README.md) and [DS-Vocab-V1](../../DS-Vocabulary/DS-Vocab-V1/README.md)).
