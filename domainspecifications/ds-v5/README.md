# DS-V5

This specification version contains further improvements to DS-V4, which include:

* Adaptions on `@context`
* Addition of a sytem to include external vocabularies
* Addition of advanced value constraints from SHACL
* Addition of errors related to new constraints
* Adaptions on how to represent the author of a DS
* An optional JSON-LD serialization of Verification Reports
* Introduction of a Vocabulary File for DS-related specifications

Motivation for these changes are the need of features like the use of external vocabularies beside schema.org, the introduction of lists as JSON-LD documents, and the need of further constraints.

Although the DS-Vocabulary file \(for DS-related specifications\) and the list specification were created based on DS-V5, they are explained for the most part in their respective specifications \([List-V1](../../lists/list-v1.md) and [DS-Vocab-V1](../../ds-vocabulary/ds-vocab-v1.md)\).
